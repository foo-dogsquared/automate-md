A blogging tool for those who use Jekyll and Hugo (probably)...

## How to use
Clone the Git repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/foo-dogsquared/automate-md.git
cd automate-md
```

For now, to use the program, you would have to build it yourself with `cmake` and `make`.

```bash
cmake CMakeLists.txt
make
```

Just for reference, here are the related tools and their version by the time I successfully built the program:
- CMake 3.6.2
- GCC 7.3.0

For the available commands, just go [here](./docs/available-commands.md).
